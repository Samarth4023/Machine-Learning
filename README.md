## 📜 Introduction  

This repository is structured into **4 weeks**, each containing:  

- **Graded Notebooks** ✅ – Includes test cases and exercises, all of which are **solved** by me.  
- **Ungraded Notebooks** 📖 – Practice notebooks meant for running and learning without test cases.  

The goal of this repository is to reinforce core ML concepts, covering **Supervised & Unsupervised Learning**, **Advanced Learning Algorithms** and more.
